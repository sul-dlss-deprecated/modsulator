  # third row is the header row that names the fields. The data rows are in the fourth row onwards.
  #
  # @return [Array<Hash>]      An array with one entry per data row in the spreadsheet. Each entry is a hash, indexed by

    # header row itself out of the resulting array. Everything preceding the header row is discarded. Would like to use
